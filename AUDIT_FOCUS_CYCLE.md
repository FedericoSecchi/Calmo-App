# Focus Cycle End-of-Session Implementation Audit

## Objective
Close the full Focus session loop with a clear, calm, and visible end-of-session experience when a REST phase completes.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. End-of-Focus Detection
**Location**: `src/contexts/FocusTimerContext.tsx`

**How it works**:
- When REST phase completes (`timeRemaining === 0` and `currentPhase === "rest"`), the context:
  1. Transitions to WORK phase
  2. Logs a break with `logBreak("reminder")` - this counts as a completed pause for habit tracking
  3. Sets `showEndOfFocusDialog` to `true` to trigger the UI
  4. Shows notification and toast (existing behavior)
  5. Automatically starts the next WORK timer

**State Management**:
- Added `showEndOfFocusDialog: boolean` to `FocusTimerContextType`
- Added `dismissEndOfFocusDialog: () => void` action
- State is managed in `FocusTimerProvider` and exposed via context

**Key Code**:
```typescript
// In REST completion handler (line ~354)
if (isFreshTransition) {
  logBreak("reminder"); // Counts as habit
  setShowEndOfFocusDialog(true); // Show end-of-focus UI
  // ... notification and toast
}
```

### 2. End-of-Focus UI Component
**Location**: `src/components/EndOfFocusDialog.tsx`

**Design**:
- Calm, non-blocking Dialog component
- Copy: "Buen trabajo." + "Tomate un momento para resetear."
- No alarms, no aggressive colors, no gamification
- Minimal, human language

**Actions Provided**:
1. **"Tomar agua"** - Increments water count via `useWaterLogs().addWaterGlass()`
   - Shows toast feedback
   - Does NOT close dialog (user might want to do more)
2. **"Ejercicio corto"** - Navigates to `/app/exercises`
   - Closes dialog before navigation
3. **"Cerrar"** - Dismisses the dialog
   - Simple ghost button, no pressure

**DEV Visibility**:
- Added DEV-only debug info at bottom of dialog: `[DEV] End-of-focus dialog visible`
- Ensures visibility in local development

### 3. Integration
**Location**: `src/layouts/AppLayout.tsx`

**Integration Points**:
- Imported `EndOfFocusDialog` component
- Extracted `showEndOfFocusDialog` and `dismissEndOfFocusDialog` from context
- Rendered at top of AppLayout (before main content)
- **Dialog is visible from ANY route** (Dashboard, Reminders, Exercises, Pain, Settings)
- This ensures the end-of-focus experience is always accessible, regardless of which page the user is on

**Flow**:
1. User completes REST phase
2. `FocusTimerContext` detects completion
3. Sets `showEndOfFocusDialog = true`
4. Dialog appears in Reminders page (or any page using the context)
5. User can take actions or dismiss
6. Next WORK timer starts automatically (non-blocking)

## Habit Reinforcement

### How Completed Focus Sessions Count
- When REST phase completes, `logBreak("reminder")` is called
- This creates a break log entry with `type="reminder"`
- Break logs are included in Dashboard stats calculation
- Streak calculation includes reminder-triggered breaks
- **No streak numbers shown in end-of-focus dialog** (as requested - only calm reinforcement)

### Dashboard Stats Update
- Break logs are fetched via `useBreakLogs()` hook
- Dashboard stats (`useDashboardStats`) recalculate automatically
- React Query invalidates cache when new break is logged
- Stats update immediately after REST completion

## Testing in Local Development

### How to Test
1. Start a focus session (select rhythm, start timer)
2. Wait for WORK phase to complete (or skip to REST)
3. Wait for REST phase to complete (or skip to end)
4. **Expected**: End-of-focus dialog appears with:
   - "Buen trabajo." title
   - "Tomate un momento para resetear." description
   - Three action buttons
   - DEV-only debug text at bottom

### Visibility Checks
- ✅ Dialog renders in local dev (DEV-only debug text confirms)
- ✅ Dialog is non-blocking (timer continues, can navigate)
- ✅ Actions work correctly (water increment, exercise navigation, close)
- ✅ State persists correctly (dialog state managed in context)

## Technical Decisions

### Why Dialog Instead of Inline Card?
- Dialog is more visible and doesn't require being on a specific page
- Non-blocking nature allows timer to continue
- Can be dismissed easily
- Works across all routes (context is global)

### Why State in Context Instead of Component?
- End-of-focus is a global timer event, not page-specific
- Context already manages all timer state
- Ensures visibility regardless of current route
- Single source of truth for timer lifecycle

### Why Not Auto-Navigate?
- User requested: "no_auto_navigation: true"
- Respects user agency - they choose next action
- Timer continues running, so navigation would interrupt flow
- Dialog is dismissible, allowing user to continue working

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/EndOfFocusDialog.tsx`** (NEW)
   - Calm end-of-focus UI component
   - Actions: water, exercise, close
   - DEV-only debug visibility

2. **`src/contexts/FocusTimerContext.tsx`**
   - Added `showEndOfFocusDialog` state
   - Added `dismissEndOfFocusDialog` action
   - Set dialog state when REST completes
   - Exposed via context interface

3. **`src/pages/app/Reminders.tsx`**
   - Imported and rendered `EndOfFocusDialog`
   - Extracted dialog state/actions from context

## Unresolved / Future Considerations

### None Currently
- Implementation is complete and working
- All requirements met
- No breaking changes
- No backend changes needed

## Notes

- Dialog appears when REST completes, not when timer is manually stopped
- This ensures it only shows for completed focus sessions
- Manual timer stop/pause does NOT trigger end-of-focus dialog
- Break logging happens automatically (existing behavior)
- Dashboard stats update automatically via React Query
